- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @WaiLik-11
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning new things everyday
- ðŸŒ± I am currently pursuing my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering, I had an interest & passion for programming. I learned coding by myself through youtube to learn more about full-stack web development. My favorite part of programming is the problem-solving aspect. I love the feeling of finally figuring out a solution to a problem. My core stack is React, Next.js, Node.js, and MongoDB. I am also familiar with TypeScript. I am always looking to learn new technologies.
